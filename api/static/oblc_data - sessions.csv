Session Block A,Career and Technical Education (CTE) Today,,"This session will provide an overview of Career and Technical Education (CTE) and its impact on students, particularly highlighting how CTE programs support student success and prepare them for future opportunities. Career and Technical Education (CTE) centers have a couple of unique advantages over traditional public schools.  One, they offer the programming that students are interested in, engagement; and two, they have an admissions process, selective.  However, they also have a great deal of state and federal requirements to meet and are monitored by the Agency of Education to a greater extent than their sending high schools.",block,4/10/2025 10:00:00,4/10/2025 10:45:00,Jodi Emerson,Pinnacle B

Session Block B,Teaching STEM / STEAM with Rapid Prototyping,,"STEM and STEAM have become essential components of K-12 education, offering incredible hands-on opportunities with cross-disciplinary approaches. These strategies provide learners with unique outlets to explore, create, and engage with real-world concepts in meaningful ways. One powerful way to bring STEM/STEAM to life is through rapid prototyping, which blends tools, software, creativity and practical problem-solving. This presentation will focus on three key rapid prototyping tools: 3D printers, laser engravers, and vinyl cutters. It aims to provide an understanding of these tools, demonstrate how they can be used to spark learners' curiosity, drive engagement, and show how rapid prototyping equipment can be woven into the curriculum. Additionally, it will guide participants on how to embed maker education into their own curricula to help foster and enhance learner  engagement in the classroom.",block,4/10/2025 11:00:00,4/10/2025 11:45:00,"Syd Telek, Veronica Newton",Pinnacle C

Students also have the opportunity to create video content for their own assignments and easily share and upload in Canvas.  By using Studio, one can choose to only share the screen and voice, share a small window of your face and screen or just your face. These options allow you to tailor your video to your needs.
