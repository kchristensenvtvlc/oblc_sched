Session Block A,Using Proficiency-Based Graduation Requirement Hierarchies to Support Flexible Pathways for Vermont Students,,"One step toward achieving educational equity is to have a common set of learning expectations for all Vermont students, regardless of their pathway to graduation. The Vermont Agency of Education recently released the Vermont Framework for Proficiency: Proficiency-Based Graduation Requirement (PBGR) Hierarchies, which support equity by providing a cohesive and coordinated vision of student-centered learning across Vermont schools. The hierarchies serve as a foundation for the implementation of standards adopted by the Vermont State Board of Education, Local Comprehensive Assessment Systems, flexible pathways, and personalized learning plans. PBGR hierarchies outline what all Vermont students should know and do across content areas upon graduation. Learn more about the hierarchy development process, hear from a Vermont leader using the hierarchies in their district, and make connections with your own work.",block,3/14/2024 9:45:00,3/14/2024 10:30:00,"Emily Leute, Kathryn Rossman, Anda Adams",Champlain Ballroom A

Not to mention also supporting the needs of various populations of students and maintaining an engaging and collaborative learning experience that is flexible and  fits in both online “live” and asynchronous environments. Discussions are one way to do this, but having them be effective and check all of those boxes requires discussion preparation. This session will guide you through the 3 things students need in order to create a thoughtful and organized discussion post, strategies on guiding students to create meaningful replies, and tools teachers can use to make the discussion process effective and successful. We will look at incorporating literacy standards in reading, writing, listening and speaking through UDL, as well as practicing skills like close reading, supporting an argument with evidence, and research. Crystal (History/Ed. Tech.) will be presenting on the traditional approach through LMS platforms and Mary Beth (STE), will be presenting on the online discussion tool Parlay.",block,3/14/2024 9:45:00,3/14/2024 10:30:00,"Crystal Chisum, Mary Beth Berrien",MacDonough

Session Block A,Flash Session 2: What's Your Why?: Work-Based Learning,,"(10:00 - 10:15) Work-Based Learning is an instructional strategy that is essential in preparing students for success in post-secondary education and careers.  The primary purpose of WBL is to expose  students to future options and provide opportunities for skill development.  Encouraging our students to dream of a future career before we can expose them to these opportunities is key. Whether it’s through paid or unpaid work experience, mentoring, informational interviews or job shadowing, our local employers have much to offer our students, today and tomorrow. The stages of Work-Based Learning can be described as learning about work, learning through work and learning for work.  So… what’s the work of interest?  What’s your why?!  It is our responsibility to encourage our students, our future, to dream.",flash,3/14/2024 9:45:00,3/14/2024 10:30:00,Heather Waryas,Library
Session Block A,Flash Session 3: Authentic and Valid Mathematics Assessments,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k_zNM_ppWzhySr3xB42N15XnaU4LkpxjuPAhHRRjTh0/edit?usp=sharing,"(10:15 - 10:30) Cheating in math courses poses a prevalent academic integrity issue, exacerbated in online settings with readily available solutions on platforms like Chegg and Brainly. The advent of ChatGBT further facilitates resourceful students in accessing online answers. Upholding learning respect hinges on academic integrity, prompting a need for educators to enlighten students on its significance. A proactive approach involves restricting easy access to online resources for solving math queries. This 15-minute lesson delves into VTVLC teachers' efforts to counter this, crafting math problems specifically designed to thwart easy online solution searches. This 15-minute lesson goes deeper into the initiatives taken by a cohort of VTVLC high school math teachers to address this challenge. They have devised math problems intentionally crafted to resist straightforward online solution searches, fostering a more authentic and intellectually rigorous learning environment that encourages critical thinking and mastery of the subject matter. This session will present their strategies along with sample before-and-after questions.",flash,3/14/2024 9:45:00,3/14/2024 10:30:00,Rebecca Lowe,Library

Session Block B,Dual Enrollment with CCV,,"College degrees open doors to a lifetime of opportunity. In 2023, Georgetown’s Center on Education and the Workforce released an economic projection report that finds Vermont is one of four states with the highest percentage of jobs in 2031 that will require a bachelor’s degree. Dual Enrollment provides a valuable onramp to college and increases the likelihood students will pursue post-secondary education after high school. CCV’s secondary education continuum provides multiple entry points for middle and high school students to experience college. Even before students are eligible to use dual enrollment vouchers, they can enroll in CCV’s free Introduction to College and Careers course to help them develop strategies for college success and explore their career and educational goals. Dual enrollment can build a student’s college transcript while also building confidence and skills. Students (who participate in D.E.) are more prepared to take advantage of college opportunities like Vermont’s Early College program and the Free Degree Promise, which offers students CCV’s Early College students access to a free associate degree. We will explore ways to help make sure all Vermont students and their families know about the amazing opportunities available to them, how and when to access them, and how we, as educators, can support them on a successful journey on this pathway.",block,3/14/2024 10:45:00,3/14/2024 11:30:00,"Natalie Searle, Sarah Kresser",Library

Session Block C,Portrait of a Graduate Informing Student Pathways,,"A Portrait of a Graduate (PoG)  is a vision that articulates the collective hopes and dreams that a community has for its students; and the skills and attributes that all students need in order to be prepared for college, career, and life. The process meaningfully engages a diverse team that represents all community partners, ensuring an equitable and representative process that unites the community. Actualized PoGs provide a guiding document outlining expectations for every student while opening flexible pathways for individual students to achieve these goals. Our team is working collaboratively with educators from across the state to think about how the PoG supports and informs instruction as well as providing context and direction for student goals. In this session, we will share examples of how portraits can drive flexibility, individuality, and creativity in students’ personalized learning plans to elevate student agency. We will discuss strategies for ongoing shifts toward equitable engagement and share tools for implementation.
