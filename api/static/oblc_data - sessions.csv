Session Block A,Using Proficiency-Based Graduation Requirement Hierarchies to Support Flexible Pathways for Vermont Students,"One step toward achieving educational equity is to have a common set of learning expectations for all Vermont students, regardless of their pathway to graduation. The Vermont Agency of Education recently released the Vermont Framework for Proficiency: Proficiency-Based Graduation Requirement (PBGR) Hierarchies, which support equity by providing a cohesive and coordinated vision of student-centered learning across Vermont schools. The hierarchies serve as a foundation for the implementation of standards adopted by the Vermont State Board of Education, Local Comprehensive Assessment Systems, flexible pathways, and personalized learning plans. PBGR hierarchies outline what all Vermont students should know and do across content areas upon graduation. Learn more about the hierarchy development process, hear from a Vermont leader using the hierarchies in their district, and make connections with your own work.",block,3/14/2024 9:45:00,3/14/2024 10:30:00,"Emily Leute, Kathryn Rossman",Champlain Ballroom C
Session Block A,Preparing Discussions to Build Literacy Skills and Rigor in the Virtual Classroom,"Oftentimes, it’s difficult to find an activity that checks many skills/literacy boxes. Not to mention also supporting the needs of various populations of students and maintaining an engaging and collaborative learning experience that is flexible and  fits in both online “live” and asynchronous environments. Discussions are one way to do this, but having them be effective and check all of those boxes requires discussion preparation. This session will guide you through the 3 things students need in order to create a thoughtful and organized discussion post, strategies on guiding students to create meaningful replies, and tools teachers can use to make the discussion process effective and successful. We will look at incorporating literacy standards in reading, writing, listening and speaking through UDL, as well as practicing skills like close reading, supporting an argument with evidence, and research. Crystal (History/Ed. Tech.) will be presenting on the traditional approach through LMS platforms and Mary Beth (STE), will be presenting on the online discussion tool Parlay.",block,3/14/2024 9:45:00,3/14/2024 10:30:00,"Crystal Chisum, Mary Beth Berrien",MacDonough

In 2023, Georgetown’s Center on Education and the Workforce released an economic projection report that finds Vermont is one of four states with the highest percentage of jobs in 2031 that will require a bachelor’s degree. Dual Enrollment provides a valuable onramp to college and increases the likelihood students will pursue post-secondary education after high school.

Even before students are eligible to use dual enrollment vouchers, they can enroll in CCV’s free Introduction to College and Careers course to help them develop strategies for college success and explore their career and educational goals. Dual enrollment can build a student’s college transcript while also building confidence and skills. Students (who participate in D.E.) are more prepared to take advantage of college opportunities like Vermont’s Early College program and the Free Degree Promise, which offers students CCV’s Early College students access to a free associate degree. We will explore ways to help make sure all Vermont students and their families know about the amazing opportunities available to them, how and when to access them, and how we, as educators, can support them on a successful journey on this pathway.",block,3/14/2024 10:45:00,3/14/2024 11:30:00,Natalie Searle,Library
