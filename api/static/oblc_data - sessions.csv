Session Block A,Project SELFIE: Keeping Youth Safe on the Internet,"Today’s youth live in a world that is fully intertwined with technology. Tweens and teens make decisions daily, often independently, regarding online relationships. This training provides adults with a deeper understanding of the multiple kinds of digital risks all youth encounter in the digital environment: online grooming, in-person grooming facilitated by digital communications, sexting, and online pornography. We also look at the legal consequences for minors engaging in consensual or non-consensual sexting. Participants will a) strategize ways to keep all youth safe in digital environments. b) learn effective strategies for dealing with youth exhibiting concerning digital behaviors. c) identify supports when youth encounter unwanted behaviors online and resources that can be accessed to remove unwanted images from the internet.",block,3/14/2024 9:45:00,3/14/2024 10:30:00,Marcie	Hambrick,Chateaugay
Session Block A,Preparing Discussions to Build Literacy Skills and Rigor in the Virtual Classroom,"Oftentimes, it’s difficult to find an activity that checks many skills/literacy boxes. Not to mention also supporting the needs of various populations of students and maintaining an engaging and collaborative learning experience that is flexible and  fits in both online “live” and asynchronous environments.

Discussions are one way to do this, but having them be effective and check all of those boxes requires discussion preparation. This session will guide you through the 3 things students need in order to create a thoughtful and organized discussion post, strategies on guiding students to create meaningful replies, and tools teachers can use to make the discussion process effective and successful. We will look at incorporating literacy standards in reading, writing, listening and speaking through UDL, as well as practicing skills like close reading, supporting an argument with evidence, and research. Crystal (History/Ed. Tech.) will be presenting on the traditional approach through LMS platforms and Mary Beth (STE), will be presenting on the online discussion tool Parlay.",block,3/14/2024 9:45:00,3/14/2024 10:30:00,"Crystal Chisum, Mary Beth Berrien",McDonough
