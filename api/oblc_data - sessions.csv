The development of this educational model was done via an innovative program grant in 2008 that was intended to increase student retention in CTE, and create flexibility in program delivery as well as give students more choice in their educational pathway.",block,4/11/2025 10:00:00,4/11/2025 10:45:00,Zach McNaughton,Beatrice
Session Block D,Use cases for Canvas Studio,,"Using Studio in Canvas as a tool to communicate with students and enhance their understanding of the learning content. Studio provides an exceptional tool to create videos for students in Canvas.  Creating video announcements each week, allows students to see and hear what assignments are due for the week.  They have the video to refer to, clearing any confusion about assignments. Studio videos also allow teachers to create a detailed video about an assignment specific to the student’s needs.  Students also have the opportunity to create video content for their own assignments and easily share and upload in Canvas.  By using Studio, one can choose to only share the screen and voice, share a small window of your face and screen or just your face. These options allow you to tailor your video to your needs. In this presentation we will dive into how to use Studio as a way to enhance student learning and engage learning.",block,4/11/2025 10:00:00,4/11/2025 10:45:00,Beth Rodondi,Collins
